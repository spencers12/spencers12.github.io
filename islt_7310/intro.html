     Hello everybody and welcome! My name is Spencer Smith and I am a teacher and coach for the state of Missouri. I grew up in rural southwest Iowa, attended Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville, MO, and graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Physical Education. Since graduation, I have been teaching elementary Physical Education in the Kansas City metropolitan area, and I obtained my Master’s Degree in Educational Leadership, also from Northwest Missouri State University.
My entire life I have had a passion for sports, adventure, education and technology. My favorite football teams are the Kansas City Chiefs and Iowa Hawkeyes. I love attending the games whenever I can and immersing myself in the electric atmosphere. My favorite vacation would definitely be my trip to the Grand Canyon with my fiance. We road tripped from KC and spent four days camping and exploring in southern Utah and northern Arizona.
At this season in my life, I am looking forward to continuing my career in education, getting married, and building great relationships with quality people around me.
