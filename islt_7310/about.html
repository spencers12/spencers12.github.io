    <h1>Spencer Smith</h1>


        <p>My name is Spencer Smith and I am a teacher and coach for the state of Missouri. I grew up in and graduated high school from a small, rural southwest Iowa farm town, and attended Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville, MO. I graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Physical Education, and since graduation, I have been teaching elementary Physical Education and coaching  in the Kansas City metropolitan area. During my first two years of teaching, I obtained my Master’s Degree in Educational Leadership, also from Northwest Missouri State University. <br/> I have passion for helping others succeed, and Physical Education is the best way for me to do so.</p>

    <h3>Favorite Quote</h3>

      <p>My <em>favorite</em> quote is from <strong>Rita Pierson</strong>, and she said these <em>powerful</em> words:</p>
            <blockquote>“Every child deserves a champion—an adult who will never give up on them, who understands the power of connection and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be.”</blockquote>
      <p>Some days it is really tough, by I try to be champion for at least one student each day.</p>
